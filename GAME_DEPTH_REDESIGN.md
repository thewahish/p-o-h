## Executive Summary

Path of Heroes currently lacks the strategic depth and variety expected of a roguelike RPG. This document proposes a comprehensive redesign introducing:

- **8 abilities per character** (2 starting, 6 unlockable)
- **Defensive actions** (Block, Dodge, Counter)
- **Skill unlock progression** tied to level milestones
- **Meaningful equipment system** with stats and special effects
- **Combo mechanics** rewarding strategic ability sequencing
- **Resource management** that creates tactical decisions

**Goal**: Transform the game from "click attack repeatedly" into a strategic RPG where every turn matters and builds/playstyles emerge organically.

---

## Current Problems

### Gameplay Loop Issues:
1. **No meaningful choices**: 95% of turns are basic attacks
2. **No build variety**: Every Warrior plays identically
3. **No defensive options**: Can only reduce damage through stats
4. **No progression excitement**: Leveling only increases numbers
5. **No replayability**: Each run feels the same
6. **No skill expression**: No way for skilled players to excel

### Technical Gaps:
- Only 2 abilities per character
- No equipment besides visual flavor
- Buffs are one-time choices with no synergy
- Combat is purely numerical (no mechanics)
- No unlocks, no skill trees, no customization

---

## Core Design Philosophy

### Guiding Principles:

**1. Depth Through Simplicity**
- Easy to learn, hard to master
- Every ability should feel impactful
- Clear visual/audio feedback for actions

**2. Meaningful Choices**
- Every turn should present decisions
- Multiple viable strategies per character
- Risk/reward trade-offs

**3. Build Variety**
- 3-5 distinct playstyles per character
- Synergies between abilities/equipment/buffs
- No obvious "best build"

**4. Progressive Mastery**
- Early runs teach basics
- Mid runs explore builds
- Late runs optimize strategies

**5. Mobile-First Design**
- Touch-friendly combat actions
- Clear visual feedback
- No twitch reflexes required

---

## Expanded Ability System

- **2 Starting Abilities**: Available from level 1

## Equipment & Loot Overhaul

2. **Armor** (DEF, HP)
3. **Accessory** (Utility: crit, speed, resource)

### Equipment Tiers

| Tier | Stat Multiplier | Special Effects | Drop Rate |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Common | 1.0x | None | 60% |
| Uncommon | 1.2x | +1 minor stat | 25% |
| Rare | 1.5x | +1 major stat or small effect | 10% |
| Epic | 1.9x | +2 stats or medium effect | 4% |
| Mythic | 2.4x | +3 stats or powerful effect | 0.8% |
| Legendary | 3.0x | Unique game-changing effect | 0.2% |

- **Vampiric**: Heal 10-20% of damage dealt
- **Flaming**: +15% fire damage + burn chance
- **Frost**: Attacks slow enemies
- **Lightning**: Chain to nearby enemies
- **Critical**: +20% crit chance

- **Lucky**: +10% rare drop chance
- **Swift**: +2-4 SPD
- **Mighty**: +10-15% all damage
- **Protective**: +10-15% all resistance

### Loot Sources

1. **Treasure Rooms**: Guaranteed equipment drop
2. **Boss Kills**: High chance of Rare+ equipment
3. **Elite Enemies**: Chance for Uncommon+ equipment
4. **Shop**: Can buy specific equipment types
5. **Shrine Blessings**: Can upgrade equipped items

### Equipment Durability System

**All equipment has durability** that degrades on death, creating meaningful consequences without being too punishing.

#### Durability Mechanics:

**Max Durability**: 100 for all equipment

**Durability Loss on Death**: 25-50% (random)
- First death: Might lose 30 durability (70/100 remaining)
- Second death: Might lose 40 durability (30/100 remaining)
- Third death: Might lose 35 durability ‚Üí **0/100 BROKEN**

**Broken Equipment**:
- Equipment at 0 durability **loses all stats and effects**
- Still appears in equipment slot but provides **NO BENEFITS**
- Cannot be destroyed or lost - you always keep the item
- Must repair to restore functionality
- Can continue playing with broken equipment (just no bonuses)

**Durability Display**:
- Shown on equipment tooltip: "Legendary Sword (85/100)"
- Color-coded warnings:
  - 100-70: Green (good condition) - full stats
  - 69-40: Yellow (needs attention) - full stats
  - 39-1: Red (danger - near breaking!) - full stats
  - 0: Gray (BROKEN - no stats!) - **provides 0 stats until repaired**

#### Repair System:

**Shop Repairs**:
- New shop option: "Repair Equipment"
- Repairs restore equipment to **100/100 durability**
- Repair costs scale with rarity:

| Rarity | Repair Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| Common | 20 gold |
| Uncommon | 50 gold |
| Rare | 100 gold |
| Epic | 200 gold |
| Mythic | 400 gold |
| Legendary | 800 gold |

**Strategic Considerations**:
- Legendary equipment is **expensive to maintain** (800 gold per repair)
- **Broken equipment still exists** - just provides 0 stats until repaired
- Can't afford repairs? Continue with broken gear (harder but playable)
- Save up gold to repair important items
- Rare equipment might be more economical than legendary (100g repairs vs 800g)
- No pressure to repair immediately - equipment never disappears

#### Death Penalty (Complete):

**When player dies**:
1. **Lose 90% of current gold** (major penalty)
2. **All equipped items lose 25-50% durability** (random per item)
3. Respawn at main menu with damaged equipment
4. Hero Souls retained (permanent progression currency)

**Example Death**:
```
Before Death:
- Gold: 1000 ‚Üí After: 100 (lost 900)
- Legendary Sword: 100/100 ‚Üí After: 60/100 (lost 40, still works!)
- Epic Armor: 80/100 ‚Üí After: 50/100 (lost 30, still works!)
- Rare Ring: 100/100 ‚Üí After: 70/100 (lost 30, still works!)

Next Run:
- All equipment still functions normally
- Can continue playing with damaged gear
- Save up 800g to repair sword eventually

After 3 More Deaths Without Repairs:
- Legendary Sword: 0/100 ‚Üí BROKEN (provides NO ATK bonus)
- Epic Armor: 0/100 ‚Üí BROKEN (provides NO DEF bonus)
- Rare Ring: 0/100 ‚Üí BROKEN (provides NO stats)
- Still have items, but playing with base character stats only
- Need 1100g total to repair everything
```

**Creates Tension**:
- Can't afford to repair everything immediately
- Must prioritize which gear to repair first
- Can continue playing with broken gear (harder but possible)
- Equipment never disappears - just becomes useless until repaired
- Death is punishing but **not run-ending** (gear becomes "dormant" not "destroyed")

---

## Combat Combo Mechanics

### Combo System

Abilities can **chain together** for bonus effects.

### Combo Types:

#### 1. Elemental Combos (Sorceress)
- **Fire + Ice = Steam Explosion**: +50% damage
- **Lightning + Water = Conductivity**: Chain to all enemies
- **Ice + Lightning = Frozen Shatter**: Stun + bonus damage

#### 2. Status Combos (Rogue)
- **Poison + Bleed = Hemorrhage**: Double DoT damage
- **Shadow Step + Backstab = Assassination**: +100% crit damage
- **Venom Strike ‚Üí Fan of Knives**: Spread poison to all enemies

#### 3. Tactical Combos (Warrior)
- **Shield Bash + Power Strike = Devastating Blow**: +80% damage
- **Battle Cry + Whirlwind = Rampage**: AoE with bonus damage
- **Defensive Stance + Counter = Retribution**: Counter deals double damage

#### 4. Buff Synergies
- **Berserker Rage + Execute**: Massive damage on low HP enemies
- **Precision Strike + Lightning Bolt**: Near-guaranteed crits
- **Vampiric Aura + Whirlwind**: Huge healing from AoE

### Combo Indicators

**UI shows combo opportunities**:
- Highlight abilities that combo with last action
- Show expected bonus damage/effect
- Tutorial teaches basic combos

---

## Resource Management Redesign

### Resource System Changes

**Problem**: Current 8 base regen makes resources infinite
**Solution**: Dynamic resource system with trade-offs

### New Resource Rules:

1. **Base Regeneration**: 4 per turn (reduced from 8)
2. **Level Scaling**: +0.5 per level (unchanged)
3. **Resource Caps**: Cannot exceed 100% (prevents hoarding)
4. **Over-cap Penalty**: Regeneration wasted if at max

### Resource Generation Sources:

- **Base Regen**: 4 per turn
- **Level Bonus**: +0.5 per level
- **Buff (Mana Surge)**: +50% regen
- **Kills**: +10% max resource per enemy killed
- **Crits**: +5% max resource on crit
- **Equipment**: +resource generation bonuses

### Strategic Resource Decisions:

**Spend Early or Save?**
- Spend early to kill fast = less damage taken
- Save for big abilities = risk taking damage
- Balance between offense and defense

**Defensive Actions vs Abilities?**
- Block costs 15% resource = can't use ability
- Dodge costs 20% resource = ~1 ability worth
- Must choose: survive or damage?

---

## UI/UX Considerations

### Battle Screen Layout

**Current Layout Issues**:
- Too many buttons (overwhelming)
- No clear action categories
- Ability descriptions hidden

**Proposed Layout**:

## Balance Testing Requirements

### Updated Simulation Criteria

**New Metrics to Track**:
1. **Ability Usage Distribution**: Which abilities used most/least?
2. **Defensive Action Usage**: How often do players block/dodge?
3. **Resource Starvation**: How often do players run out?
4. **Combo Frequency**: How often do combos trigger?
5. **Equipment Impact**: Win rate with vs without good equipment?
6. **Level Milestones**: Do players survive to key unlocks (3, 6, 9)?
7. **Build Diversity**: Are multiple playstyles viable?

### Success Criteria

**Balance Goals**:
- Win rate: 25-35% (10 deaths per victory)
- Average death floor: 8-12 (gradual progression)
- Ability usage: 40-50% of turns (more abilities = more use)
- Defensive action usage: 15-25% of turns
- All 8 abilities used: Each ability used >5% of the time
- Resource starvation: 10-20% of battles
- Equipment matters: 10-15% win rate improvement with good gear

### Simulation Updates Needed

1. **Implement ability unlock progression**: Simulator grants abilities at correct levels
2. **Add defensive action AI**: AI decides when to block/dodge
3. **Equipment system**: Generate and equip items
4. **Combo detection**: Track and apply combo bonuses
5. **Strategic AI**: Make smarter ability choices based on situation

## Open Questions for Discussion

### Critical Decisions:

1. **Talent System**: Include persistent talent trees or skip for now?
2. **Equipment Persistence**: Keep equipment between runs (roguelite) or lose on death (roguelike)?
3. **Ability Cooldowns**: Use cooldowns + resource costs, or just resource costs?
4. **Combo Complexity**: Simple 2-ability combos or deeper 3+ ability chains?
5. **Defensive Action Timing**: Real-time parry timing or turn-based decisions only?
6. **Tutorial Integration**: How do we teach 8 abilities + defensive actions + combos?
7. **Mobile vs Desktop Balance**: Different controls for mobile vs keyboard?

### Balance Questions:

1. **Resource Costs**: Should ultimates cost 40-50 resource (most of pool)?
2. **Cooldowns**: Should powerful abilities have 4-6 turn cooldowns?
3. **Equipment Power**: How much should Legendary equipment change gameplay?
4. **Level Pacing**: Reach level 18 (ultimate unlock) by floor 15-20?
5. **Combo Damage**: Should combos add +30-50% bonus damage?
