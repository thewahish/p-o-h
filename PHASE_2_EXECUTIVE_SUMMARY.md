## KEY METRICS

### Effort Distribution

| Priority | Tasks | Hours | % of Total |
|----------|-------|-------|------------|
| **P0 (Critical)** | 5 | 14-15h | 31% |
| **P1 (High)** | 4 | 11h | 24% |
| **P2 (Medium)** | 4 | 11h | 24% |
| **Buffer/Testing** | - | 18h | 40% |
| **Total Effort** | **13** | **45-60h** | **100%** |

### Critical Path Analysis

**Longest Sequential Path:** 17 hours
- Task 1.1 (4h) → Task 1.2 (4h) → Task 2.1 (3h) → Task 2.3 (3h) → Task 3.1 (2h) → Integration (1h)

**Parallelizable Work:** 28 hours
- With 2 developers, can reduce timeline to 1.5 weeks

**Minimum Viable Phase 2:** 15 hours (P0 tasks only)
- Character encounters + basic rewards + auto-save triggers

---

## DEPENDENCY STRUCTURE

### Critical Path (Must be Sequential)
```
START → Task 1.1 → Task 1.2 → Task 1.3
             ↓
        Task 2.1 → Task 2.2 → Task 2.3
             ↓
        Task 3.1 → INTEGRATION → END
```

### Parallel Paths (Can Run Simultaneously)
```
Task 2.4 (Shrine Blessings) ──┐
Task 3.2 (Save UI Feedback) ──┼── Can run in parallel
Task 3.3 (Save Recovery) ──────┤   with critical path
Task 4.1 (Shop Enhancement) ───┤
Task 4.2 (Campfire System) ────┤
Task 4.3 (Mystery Events) ─────┘
```

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High-Risk Items (Require Mitigation)

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Repetitive Encounters** | High | 30% | Variety boost system |
| **Insufficient Reward Items** | Medium | 60% | 12+ items per character |
| **Character Balance Issues** | Medium | 40% | Extensive simulation testing |

### Low-Risk Items (Monitoring Only)

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Auto-Save Performance** | Low | 10% | Debouncing |
| **Mystery Event Balance** | Low | 35% | Clear telegraphing |

**Overall Risk Level:** 🟡 MEDIUM

## SUPPORT & ESCALATION

### Technical Questions
**Refer to existing code:**
- `src/core/state.js` - State management patterns
- `src/systems/dungeon.js` - Enemy generation logic
- `src/systems/combat.js` - Battle and reward flow
- `src/constants/characters.js` - Character progression paths

### Blocked Tasks
1. Check dependency graph in PHASE_2_TASK_PLAN.md
2. Review risk mitigation strategies
3. Consider de-scoping to P0 tasks if timeline critical

### Scope Changes
1. Update priority matrix
2. Recalculate critical path
3. Adjust sprint breakdown
4. Document changes in PHASE_2_RETROSPECTIVE.md

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Do's ✓
1. **Start with P0 tasks** - Ensure critical path completes first
2. **Test frequently** - Run tests after each task completion
3. **Commit often** - Small, focused commits with clear messages
4. **Use the quick reference** - Keep it open while coding
5. **Track progress daily** - Update the progress tracker every evening
6. **Ask for help early** - Don't wait until blocked for days

### Don'ts ✗
1. **Don't skip testing** - Each task has acceptance criteria for a reason
2. **Don't add scope** - Phase 2 is well-defined, save ideas for Phase 3
3. **Don't hardcode strings** - Always use localization system
4. **Don't skip documentation** - Update README/CLAUDE as you go
5. **Don't optimize prematurely** - Get it working, then optimize if needed
6. **Don't work in isolation** - Share progress with team regularly
