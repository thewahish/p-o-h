**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** Critical Systems Integration In Progress

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Potion System Integration
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/battle-screen.jsx` - Added potion buttons and handler
- `src/constants/config.js` - Updated starting inventory
- `src/core/state.js` - Added PotionSystem initialization

### 2. Starting Inventory Fix
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Files Modified:**
- `src/constants/config.js` (line 35-38)

**Changes:**
```javascript
startingPotions: [
    { type: 'hp_potion', quantity: 3 },         // 150 HP total
    { type: 'resource_potion', quantity: 2 }    // 80 resource total
]
```

**Result:** Matches documentation claims!

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### 5. Update Battle UI to Show Active Buffs
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Next Steps:**
- Add active buffs display section to battle-screen.jsx
- Show buff icons, names, and effects
- Position below player stats or above combat log

---

### 6. Wire Buff Effects into Combat Calculations
**Status:** üîÑ PENDING
**Next Steps:**
- Import `BuffSystem` in `src/systems/combat.js`
- Call `BuffSystem.processBuffEffects('turn_start')` at turn start
- Call `BuffSystem.processBuffEffects('damage_dealt', {damage})` after attacks
- Call `BuffSystem.processBuffEffects('ability_used', {cost})` when using abilities
- Test all 9 buff types

---

## ‚è≥ REMAINING TASKS

### 7. Create Realistic Combat Simulator
**Estimate:** 3-4 hours
**Requirements:**
- Model resource consumption (abilities cost mana/vigor/energy)
- Model resource regeneration (8+ per turn)
- Model potion usage (HP and resource potions)
- Model buff selection and effects
- Simulate actual gameplay decisions

---

### 8. Run Comprehensive Balance Simulations
**Estimate:** 2 hours
**Requirements:**
- Run 1000+ simulations per character
- Test floors 1-30
- Generate win/loss statistics
- Identify difficulty spikes
- Compare to previous simulations

---

### 9. Update Documentation
**Estimate:** 1 hour
**Files to Update:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Match current implementation
- `README.md` - Update feature list
- `COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_REPORT.md` - Mark completed items

---

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

**Working Features:**
- ‚úÖ Potion system (fully functional)
- ‚úÖ Buff selection (fully functional)
- ‚úÖ Starting inventory (correct quantities)
- ‚úÖ Buff integration (shows before battles)

**Partially Working:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Buff effects (applied but not processed in combat)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Active buff display (not shown in UI)

**Not Working:**
- ‚ùå Buff effects in combat calculations (needs wiring)
- ‚ùå Realistic balance simulations (needs new simulator)

## üìä ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETION

| Task | Status | Time Remaining |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Active buff UI | In Progress | 30 mins |
| Wire buff effects | Pending | 1-2 hours |
| Realistic simulator | Pending | 3-4 hours |
| Run simulations | Pending | 2 hours |
| Update docs | Pending | 1 hour |
| **TOTAL** | | **7.5-9.5 hours** |

---

## üöÄ NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. Add active buffs display to battle UI (30 mins)
2. Wire buff effects into combat.js (1-2 hours)
3. Test all features in actual gameplay
4. Create realistic simulator
5. Run balance simulations
6. Update documentation

---

## üí° NOTES

- All critical features now exist in codebase
- Main work remaining is wiring and balance validation
- Game is playable but buffs don't affect combat yet
- Simulations will need complete rewrite to be accurate
